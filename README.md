## Credit Card Default Classification
In this project we will conduct a simple comperative study on different classification models of predicting credit card fraud to decide which classifier provides the best accuracy and to find out how many variables are necessary to consist the final predictors of default payment. The classification models include SVM, KNN, decision tree and forest tree. And we employed PCA to achieve dimentionality reduction.
